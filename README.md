## UserQuizMaker
A program that makes a quiz based on your Steam account. 


## What it does?
The initial idea was to make a quiz about your LastFM profile, then I wanted to make of Steam, LastFM and Spotify, but sticked to just Steam, but the "skeleton" of the project its quite ready, but I won't add them so soon, for know its just the "_Steam Quiz Maker_".
* The site is entirely on portuguease, and english support is the first thing I'll add if I go back to this project.

## How it does?
You just click on "create a quiz" and paste the link to your steam profile. To get it, you can go to your profile on the Steam app and copy the link that stays up in the page: 
(mine is just 'CaioEmPessoa' bc you can custom one for you, but your's probably is just some random characters)

Because of how Steam API works, your profile needs to attend the following requirements:
- Your profile needs to have all things public
- You need to have spent more than 5 dolars on Steam
- And I recommend to have more than 4 games.

Then you can just click on the generated link or share it with someone to have some fun :)
