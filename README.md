## PersonaQuiz
A website that makes quizes about your online persona based on the websites you like. 


## What it does?
For now it only makes quizes about Steam profiles, but I'll work hard to make an LastFM and Spotify too, and I could add more websites if asked.
* The site is entirely on portuguease, and english support is one of my top priorities.

## How it does?
Well for know this part will be about the Steam quiz, the one that's ready.
You just click on "create a quiz" and paste the link to your steam profile. To get it, you can go to your profile on the Steam app and copy the link that stays up in the page: 
(mine is just 'CaioEmPessoa' bc you can custom one for you, but your's probably is just some random characters)

Because of how Steam API works, your profile needs to attend the following requirements:
- Your profile needs to have all things public
- You need to have spent more than 5 dolars on Steam
- And I recommend to have more than 4 games.

Then you can just click on the generated link or share it with someone to have some fun :)
